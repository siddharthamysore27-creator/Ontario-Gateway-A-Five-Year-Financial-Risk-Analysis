# Ontario-Gateway-A-Five-Year-Financial-Risk-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project analyzes the financial risks of four insurance plans â€” RCNC1, RCNC2, CTC, and HIC for Ontario Gateway, a major airline. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we assess the cost and risk of each plan over a five-year period to recommend the most suitable policy. The ultimate goal is to help the company avoid incurring liabilities greater than $37 million for the first year, a key safety threshold.

# Key Findings
* RCNC2: Offers the lowest average total costs over five years ($44,981,615.90), making it the most cost-effective option. While its costs have a higher standard deviation ($4,082,457.19), its average cost is significantly lower than all other plans.
* CTC: Provides a plan with slightly higher average costs ($66,530,477.59) but with a much lower standard deviation ($659,157.97). This plan offers greater cost predictability, which can be valuable for managing a budget.
* HIC: This plan has an average cost ($62,526,835.41) and standard deviation ($2,862,304.16) that are similar to the CTC plan, offering a balanced alternative.

# Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the RCNC2 plan is recommended for Ontario Gateway. It provides the most effective balance of cost and risk, with the lowest overall average cost. While the CTC plan offers slightly more stability in costs, the substantial savings provided by RCNC2 make it the superior choice for the company.
