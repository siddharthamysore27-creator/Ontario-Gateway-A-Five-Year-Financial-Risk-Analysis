# Ontario-Gateway-A-Five-Year-Financial-Risk-Analysis
This project analyzes the financial risks of four insurance plans—RCNC1, RCNC2, CTC, and HIC—for Ontario Gateway. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we assess each plan's cost and risk of exceeding a $41 million liability threshold over five years to recommend the most suitable policy.
